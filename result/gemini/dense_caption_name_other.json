Coco corrects him, stating that she actually believes the man who stole the items deserved what happened to him.\n00:38~00:54 The woman in the beige suit expresses disbelief, pointing out that he was acting on behalf of his country and it was his duty as a soldier. She is relieved that he was rescued by a passing Chinese merchant ship. Coco, however, sarcastically remarks that heaven must have been blind back then.\n00:54~01:04 The woman asks Coco to repeat what she said, and the man translates it as \"Thank goodness he came back\". The woman in the beige suit points out that this was not what Coco said, but thanks the man anyway. He replies \"You're welcome\".\n01:05~01:17 The woman in the beige suit asks Coco what she is doing as Coco picks up a scroll. Coco replies that she is taking it back to China. The woman protests, saying that this is her home and Coco cannot just take anything she wants. Coco argues that just like over a hundred years ago, the woman's ancestors took the painting without asking anyone.\n01:18~01:35 The man tries to calm the situation, saying that those events happened a long time ago. He jokes that back then, a woman wearing revealing clothes might get stoned, gesturing towards the woman in the beige suit. He quickly corrects himself, pointing to Coco instead, and apologizes for the mistake.\n01:36~01:43 Coco tells the man not to apologize and not to be a pushover, asserting that the ones who should be apologizing are the woman and her ancestors. The woman asks what Coco said, and the man hesitates to translate.\n01:44~02:06 Coco states that she doesn't need the man to translate for her. She reminds everyone present that over a hundred years ago, their ancestors came to China and burned, killed, and looted. She emphasizes that even a hundred years later, these events remain a painful memory for the Chinese people.\n02:09~02:40 The woman in the beige suit acknowledges the truth of Coco's words, stating that she has studied history. She admits that sometimes these events can only be explained by unreasonable justifications, such as \"might makes right\". The man adds that they cannot use today's civilized standards to judge the mistakes of the past, pointing out that even now, the strong are the ones who prevail. He concludes that one must possess power before others will listen to reason.\n02:40~02:59 The woman in the beige suit tells Coco that she is beginning to understand her perspective. She apologizes to Coco and admits that in the end, all of the items they are arguing about belong to the bank and are worthless to her. She states that she would give them to Coco if she could. The man then turns to Coco, asking if this is what she wanted all along. He points out that it wasn't easy to get to this place and proposes that they stay for two days before leaving. He offers Coco a cup of tea.\n02:59~03:00 The woman in the beige suit starts speaking in French.",

Officer Lei is fine but looks embarrassed and flustered.\n01:16~01:26 Officer Lei picks up the book, showing it to Shen Hanqiang, then points at a loose thread stuck under the leg of a table. Shen Hanqiang kneels down to take a closer look.\n01:27~01:41 Shen Hanqiang pulls out the loose thread from under the table leg, finds a small white bead attached to it and examines it carefully. \n01:42~01:48 Shen Hanqiang and Officer Lei visit Mrs. Zhang's house. Shen Hanqiang knocks on the door, and Mrs. Zhang opens it.\n01:49~02:10 Shen Hanqiang apologizes to Mrs. Zhang for the inconvenience. He tells her that they have re-examined the testimonies and found an issue.  Shen Hanqiang brings up Mrs. Zhang's previous statement that she knocked on Li Xiaoyun’s door at 9:01pm, and that Li Xiaoyun responded that everything was fine. \n02:11~02:17 Shen Hanqiang tells Mrs. Zhang that according to police records, Li Xiaoyun called the police at 9:03 pm, leaving only a two minute gap. \n02:18~02:23 Mrs. Zhang insists that she didn't remember incorrectly. She is certain that she arrived at Li Xiaoyun’s house at 9:01pm.\n02:24~02:49 Officer Lei asks Mrs. Zhang how she could remember so precisely. Mrs. Zhang explains that she watches the show “Silent Bird” every evening. That day she heard fighting in Li Xiaoyun's house, but didn't leave right away because she was watching TV. The show airs the next episode's preview at 8:59 pm and switches to commercials at 9:00pm. Mrs. Zhang left after watching the preview. She estimates it took her at most one minute to walk to Li Xiaoyun’s door. \n02:50~02:57 Officer Lei looks thoughtful and rubs his sore leg, saying it hurts.\n02:57~03:00 Shen Hanqiang asks Mrs. Zhang if she knows where Li Huilan went after leaving home.",

The scene transitions back to the interrogation room.\n02:36~02:50 Officer Shen tells Jiang Feng that the item is wrapped in tape and won't kill him even if swallowed. He suggests Jiang Feng vomit it or pass it out later. Officer Shen believes as long as the police think Jiang Feng is not faking, they would send him to the hospital for sure.\n02:51~02:59 Jiang Feng looks nervous and hesitant.

Jiang Feng says he went to the Memory Master but they were uncooperative and insisted on a search warrant. Officer Shen acknowledges this and says he can't investigate who swapped memories with Jiang Feng for now as applying for a warrant would take a long time.
