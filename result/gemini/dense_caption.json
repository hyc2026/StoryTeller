She concedes that sometimes historical actions can only be explained by the logic of power.\n02:22~02:40 Jackie reiterates that past wrongs cannot be judged by contemporary standards and says that power still dictates reason in the present day.\n02:40~02:46 Laura states that she understands Coco's perspective, and Jackie apologizes to her again.\n02:47~02:52 Laura remarks that ultimately, the antiques are just bank assets, meaning nothing to her.
