The man replies that back then, their Qing government considered itself as the Celestial Empire.\n00:06~00:17 Coco then asks the man, Zhang Zhichen, if he is helping her or the woman in the suit, who is a descendant of the soldier who stole treasures from China. Zhang Zhichen says he is helping Coco and asks what's next. Coco's assistant replies that the stolen items were too many and heavy, and the ship sank during the storm. Coco adds that this is retribution.\n00:17~00:25 The woman in the suit asks Coco what she said. Coco replies that she does not speak English. The big-nosed man translates for Coco, saying that she said it was unfortunate. \n00:25~00:39 Coco, frustrated, insists she said the solider deserved it. The woman in the suit translates for Coco. Bian Bian, shocked, tries to defend her ancestor, saying that he went to China on a national mission and it was his duty as a soldier. She adds that he was rescued by a Chinese merchant ship. \n00:39~01:04 Coco sarcastically comments that heaven had no eyes. The woman in the suit asks her what she said. Zhang Zhichen translates, saying that Coco said, \"Thank goodness he came back.\" The woman in the suit thanks Zhang Zhichen, despite knowing that he did not translate accurately.\n01:04~01:18 Coco then tries to take a scroll, saying she is taking it back to China. Bian Bian stops her, saying she cannot just take anything she wants. Coco argues that her ancestors took the painting without asking over 100 years ago. \n01:18~01:35  A man tries to stop Coco and calm Bian Bian down. He says that things happened a long time ago and that throwing stones at women who dressed indecently used to be a common practice. \n01:35~02:08 Coco, still angry, tells the man that she does not need him to translate for her. She speaks in French, reminding Bian Bian that over 100 years ago, Bian Bian's ancestors burned, killed, looted, and plundered in China. She emphasizes that these events are painful memories for the Chinese people. \n02:08~02:40 Bian Bian admits it is true and that she has studied history. She argues that those events did happen, but sometimes such things can only be explained with unreasonable reasons, like \"might makes right.\" Zhang Zhichen adds that they cannot use today's standards to judge the past and that even now, it is the strong who are in power. He concludes that Coco needs to be strong for others to reason with her. \n02:40~02:59 The woman in the suit apologizes to Coco, saying she is starting to understand Coco's point of view. She adds that those treasures now belong to the bank and have no value to her. She would even give them to Coco if she could.\n02:59~03:00  The man serving the tea asks Coco if she wants to enter the fort. He says they will stay with her for two days and leave. He offers Coco some tea. Zhang Zhichen thanks the man for the tea.",

He then takes a boat to the island.\n02:49~03:00 JC and his team arrive at the island and release a remote-controlled helicopter. The pilot of a nearby helicopter spots the remote-controlled helicopter through his binoculars and wonders what JC and his team are doing there.",

Lu Li is shocked and asks why she didn't tell him sooner. Xiao Xing explains that she believed the driver when he said he had just cleaned the car. Lu Li is angry and says that propofol is a powerful anesthetic. Xiao Xing realizes that Tang Zheng must have added the anesthetic to the coffee he offered her.\n02:05~02:13 Xiao Xing and Lu Li are both worried.

King Kong responds, \"There are rules to be a thief, I don't kill, but I can ask someone else to, The money spent was worth it\".\n02:44~02:54 King Kong smiles at Zhang Dan, and says, \"I consider you as my son\", as he puts on his glasses. \n02:55~03:00  Zhang Dan looks into King Kong's eyes and asks, \"Do you know who called the police?\".
